## What is *prestissimo*

*prestissimo* is a serverless application that will allow a music producer to upload a file (e.g. WAV, AIFF, MP4, etc), convert them to the appropriate format (e.g. WAV -> MP3), and upload to them to target platforms (e.g. [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/alexanderthepaz).

## Why

Distributing media file on different platforms (such as [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/alexanderthepaz) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNmoQ2_AFvYaOdvJjAFlvRw)) is a tedious endevour. *prestissimo* attempts to solve this issue by automating the process.
